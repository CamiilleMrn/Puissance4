# Power4

Power4 is a project I realized as an 11th grader, it's a python version of the board game we played. I had one obligation which was that I had
to use dictionaries instead of classes.


I am now in college and I want to redo it to see my improvment.

This repository is composed of my old program and the new one. I haven't finished yet so I will update weekly.
